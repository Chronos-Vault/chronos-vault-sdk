 Security Documentation
Create a comprehensive security documentation page that explains:

The technical architecture behind the security features
How each security level works (Standard, Enhanced, Maximum)
Best practices for securing their vaults
FAQs about security measures
This detailed documentation helps build trust with more technical users and serves as a reference.

2. Security UI Cards/Panels
For the user interface, I recommend creating visually appealing security information cards:

Security Dashboard Cards
Security Status Card: Shows current security level and overall security score
Protection Features Card: Lists active protection features with simple on/off toggles
Recent Activity Card: Shows recent security events and analyzed transactions
Backup Status Card: Displays last backup time and restore points available
Vault Creation Security Options
Security Level Selector: Shows the three security levels with brief explanations
Custom Security Options: Allows users to customize security features like multi-signature requirements
Security Onboarding Cards
Welcome Security Tour: Brief cards explaining key security features during onboarding
Security Level Recommendation: Personalized security level recommendations based on vault value
3. Visual Security Indicators
Throughout the application, add visual cues about security:

Security Badge: Shows vault security level (Standard/Enhanced/Maximum)
Protection Icons: Small icons indicating which protections are active (Multi-sig, Quantum, etc.)
Security Health Indicator: Visual gauge showing overall security strength
4. Marketing Materials
For the public-facing website and marketing:

Security Feature Comparison: Easy-to-read table comparing security levels
Technology Explainers: Simple explanations of advanced concepts like zero-knowledge proofs
Security Infographics: Visual representations of the Triple-Chain Security architecture
5. Security Notifications
Implementation of contextual security information:

Security Tips: Contextual tips when users perform certain actions
Security Alerts: Real-time notifications about detected anomalies
Security Recommendations: Suggestions to improve security based on usage patterns
